# airbnb-clone-project
## This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform AirBnB. The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings. The project will cover frontend development, backend APIs, database design, and deployment.
## UI/UX Design Planning
- Document design goals and key features
- Create page descriptions for main views
- Analyze Figma design specifications
- Identify color schemes and typography
### Color Styles:
- Primary: #FF5A5F
- Secondary: #008489
- Background: #FFFFFF
- Text: #222222
- Secondary Text: #717171
### Typography:
- Primary Font: Circular, Medium (500), 16px
- Headings: Circular, Bold (700), 24px-32px
- Secondary Text: Circular, Book (400), 14px
